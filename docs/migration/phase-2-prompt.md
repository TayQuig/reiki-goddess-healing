# The Reiki Goddess Healing Project - Phase 2 Implementation

## Project Context

I need to continue work on The Reiki Goddess Healing project. Please read these files in exact order:

1. **First**: `context_summary.md` - Current project status
2. **Then**: `phase_1_deployment_prompt.md` - Phase 1 completion status
3. **Finally**: `learning-loop/progress/dashboard.md` - Current state summary

## Current Status

**Phase 1 agent deployment COMPLETE (7/7 agents deployed)**

- All specialized research agents finished comprehensive analysis
- Critical architecture decisions resolved
- Implementation plans ready for execution

## Your Task

Review the completed research from all 7 agents and begin Phase 2 implementation:

- **@learning-curator**: Pattern extraction complete
- **@reiki-frontend-strategist**: Component architecture planned
- **@business-domain-strategist**: Business requirements defined
- **@infrastructure-strategist**: Deployment strategy ready
- **@qa-strategist**: Testing framework designed
- **@security-strategist**: Security strategy complete
- **@business-api-strategist**: API integration planned

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Should show 7+ tasks
find learning-loop/tasks/current/ -name "planning.md" | wc -l

# Should show all agent task folders
ls learning-loop/tasks/current/

# Should show agent research folders
find learning-loop/research/ -type d
```

## Next Action

Begin implementing the comprehensive plans created by all agents, starting with the component extraction strategy from @reiki-frontend-strategist.

Follow the learning loop protocol: **implement → validate → extract learnings → improve**.
