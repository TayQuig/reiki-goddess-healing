- Git hooks successfully trigger on commits
- Backed up original .claude directory for reference
- Cleaner, more reliable automation solution

  Message: feat(testing): implement test failure documentation system

- Add test-documentation.py hook to capture and document test failures
- Add test-summary-generator.py for context refresh summaries
- Create testing/ directory structure for component test docs
- Update CLAUDE.md to include testing summaries in context recovery
- Update hook.sh to route test commands to documentation hooks
- Update settings.json to trigger on Bash tool test runs
- Create example documentation and README for testing system

This system documents test failures instead of fixing tests, tracking bugs per component for later investigation and fixing.
