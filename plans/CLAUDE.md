# Plans Directory

## Overview

This directory contains implementation plans generated by the `/plan-feature` command. Each plan includes comprehensive task breakdowns for feature implementation.

## Structure

```
/plans/
├── CLAUDE.md                     # This file
├── README.md                     # Directory documentation
└── [feature-name]/              # Feature-specific plans (generated)
    └── implementation-plan.md   # Generated by /plan-feature command
```

## Generated Plan Format

The `/plan-feature` command creates implementation plans with:

- Executive summary
- Task breakdown in YAML format
- Dependency graphs (Mermaid)
- Agent assignments
- Resource requirements
- Success metrics

## Task Types

Each task in a plan specifies an agent type:

- `frontend` → Frontend React/TypeScript implementation
- `backend` → API endpoints and service logic
- `integration` → Service-to-service connections
- `testing` → Test implementation
- `database` → Schema and migrations
- `security` → Security validation
- `performance` → Optimization tasks

## Integration with /implement-feature

The `/implement-feature` command reads these plans to:

1. Parse task breakdowns from implementation-plan.md
2. Resolve task dependencies
3. Dispatch tasks to appropriate agents
4. Track progress via TodoWrite
5. Validate outputs against acceptance criteria

## Important Notes

- Plans are generated by `/plan-feature`, not manually created
- Each task maps to a specialized agent in `/docs/agents/implementation/`
- Tasks include parallel tracks for efficient execution
- Dependencies determine execution order
